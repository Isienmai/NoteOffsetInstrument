This is a python implementation of the instrument in an attempt to be compatible with Windows as well as Linux.

Requires:
	-pyaudio
	-numpy



The Bash script allows the python to be run using any installed version of python. (My python installs are all over the place, needed to specify the one which has access to pyaudio.)
